This is a repository for ongoing developement. When there is enough work to be published, I will publish and prepare a README. For now, the code will be a one time run calculational tool for university students' outcome based performence. It inputs excel files containing necessary information about each course than parses, and calculates every students success by course outcomes, program outcomes, individual grades of exam quesitons and ECTS credits.
